IRC Protocol Test Server

*STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS, CURRENTLY ONLY THE SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE IS IMPLEMENTED*

For those of us who use IRC bots, clients, bouncers and other utilities as small projects to learn a new language.  Just code up your client and run it against this server until the tests that you want to pass are green.
